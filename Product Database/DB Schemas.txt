CREATE TABLE Inverters(Name STRING, Price DOUBLE, Efficiency int, Watts int, InputV int, OutputV int);
	Notes:	* InputV is stored as Volts in DC
		* OutputV is stored as Volts in AC
		* Watts concern how much power will be available at any given time
			-For example, an inverter that is consistently outputting 60 Watts (no additional power being supplied) it will be able to power a 60 Watt appliance until the power supply ceases to produce energy.
	
CREATE TABLE Panels (Name STRING, Price DOUBLE, SystemCap INT, Amps DOUBLE, Volts Double, PowerTolerance INT, module_type INT, Dimensions STRING);
	Notes: 	* the power tolerance factors into the TOTAL LOSS of a system's power.
		* module_type corresponds to the PVWatts ranking for panel efficiency.
		* Dimensions are measured in inches, separated by '/'

CREATE TABLE Batteries (Name STRING, Price DOUBLE, Voltage INT, AmpHours INT);

CREATE TABLE Racking (Name STRING, Price DOUBLE, SizePerModule STRING, RoofMounted INT);
	Notes:	* RoofMounted works as a boolean variable, where 
			1 == roofmounted 
			0 == groundmounted

CREATE TABLE DCACDisconnect (Name STRING, Price REAL, Amps INT, Volts INT);
	Notes:	* Amps value shows at what current the system disconnects
		* Volts value shows what voltage is outputted 

CREATE TABLE BatteryControllers (Name STRING, Price DOUBLE, BankVoltage STRING, MaxAmpPerController STRING);
	Notes:	* BankVoltage shows all possible voltages that a controller can operate under (different types separate by '&')
		* MaxAmpPerController shows how much ampheres exist under certain voltages. The format of this string is [Amps]/[BankVoltage]&[Other Bank Voltages]

CREATE TABLE BatteryMeter (Name STRING, Price DOUBLE, Features STRING);

CREATE TABLE "PVWires" (Name STRING, Price DOUBLE, LengthInFeet INT, CableType STRING);

CREATE TABLE BatteryWires (Name String, Price DOUBLE, LengthInInches INT, Gauge BLOB);
