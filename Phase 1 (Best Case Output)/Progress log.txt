-need to tweak equation to get proper sunrise/sunset schedules. Must do this before continuing to the rest of the equations. For future reference, the url of the main resource is:
	http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/calculation-of-solar-insolation
-oh, and I see that there is a more reliable equation for sunrise/set on that same page. I'll do it tomorrow, I need to sleep.

-woke up, think i figured out the sunrise/set equation. Use this for declination:

-Also, divide arccos by 15, make every trig function use degrees, and add the result by one (to account for 12:00 am in the day)

-gave up on making the sunset/rise prediction equation. Just using an API instead. That works, so I'm going to integrate that with the rest of the pveducation equations.

-currently trying to find the solar insolation for a given day. I have the equations all together, which involves calculating air mass, solar insolation, and the length of daylight hours. I linked air mass with the grander solar insolation equation, I am now needing to find out how to use the hours of daylight in an hour to extend the period length of the other equation to match the day.
I think I have the equation working. Was frustrated with tyring to integrate the sunlight hours into the graph, but I think I found something which may render that useless. Pveducation says there is roughly 12 hours of sunlight on average over the year, meaning that taking all daylight hours in a year and dividing them by 365 gives you 12. I will test this tomorrow with the API to see if it is accurate.
On an off note, even if I don't get twelve, I could still use the avg hours to assert that the Id equation can run with one number, as opposed to running itself for each specific day.

-I was able to show that any area on the earth gets a daily avg of 12 hours of sunlight annually. I'll use that constant of 12 for now to work on the solar insolation equation. I think the formulas needed to predict that must span the length of 12 hours, and to find total solar insolation in a day I would need the area under the curve (integral). The only problem is that the result would entail that all places on earth have the same annual solar insolation. While that might be somewhat true (variations in sea level would likely disprove that hypothesis) I would still have problems in finding what the annual solar insolation IS. 
-The big issue with the solar insolation is with the peak hour. While I've been able to create the span of the daytime hour, I haven't been able to change the peak. The cause of peak change I'm sure I know: the changing of seasons and earth declination, bringing the earth closer to the sun and possibly affecting the air mass.
-I'm going to attempt to turn some of the data points visible on pveducation into graphs using logger pro, hopefully I can get some indication of how their formulas are working. 
	*This did not work as well as I had planned. the slope of this graph was too unfitting for the data.

-Turning in for the night. I think the solar irradiance thing has played out for this week. I'll revisit the problem when I meet with Pan's associate. Till then, I'll spend time think over other aspects of the master problem.
